### Week 1 Tweets

#### Day 1 (Already Posted)
- ✅ Launch announcement

#### Day 2
1. "Your AI writes 'utilize' when your brand says 'use'. It capitalizes Product Names randomly. It adds exclamation points everywhere!!! StyleMCP catches these before they reach your customers."

2. "StyleMCP rules are just YAML files you can version control. Push to main, your brand stays consistent across every AI touchpoint. That's it. That's the workflow."

3. "Poll: What's your biggest AI content headache? 🔹 Inconsistent tone 🔹 Wrong terminology 🔹 Off-brand formatting 🔹 All of the above 😅"

#### Day 3
1. "Style rule of the day: prefer: original: 'reach out' replacement: 'contact' Why? Because 'reach out' is corporate jargon. Your users just want to contact you."

2. "StyleMCP works as an MCP server. That means Claude, Cursor, and other MCP-enabled tools can validate content in real-time as they write. No copy-paste needed."

3. "Built something with StyleMCP? We'd love to see it! Drop a link or tell us about your setup 👇"

#### Day 4
1. "The problem with AI content isn't that it's bad. It's that it's inconsistently good. One email sounds like your brand, the next sounds like a LinkedIn influencer. StyleMCP fixes that."

2. "Tip: Start with 5 rules, not 50. Your most common violations: • Brand name capitalization • Banned words/phrases • Tone (formal vs casual) • One formatting rule Add more as you find patterns."

3. "What style violations drive you crazy? The ones that make you twitch every time you see them in AI output. We're collecting examples for our docs 📝"

#### Day 5
1. "GitHub Action + StyleMCP = automated brand checks on every PR. AI-generated docs, changelogs, marketing copy—all validated before merge."

2. "StyleMCP doesn't just flag problems. It rewrites. 'Please don't hesitate to reach out!' → 'Contact us anytime.' Same meaning. Your voice."

3. "Friday thought: The best AI tools don't replace human judgment. They encode it. StyleMCP turns your style decisions into executable rules."

#### Day 6-7 (Weekend - lighter posting)
1. "Weekend project idea: Export your company's style guide to StyleMCP rules. It's easier than you think. Start here: stylemcp.com/docs"

2. "Quiet weekend thought: Every company has a voice. Most just haven't written it down. StyleMCP helps you make it explicit—and enforceable."
