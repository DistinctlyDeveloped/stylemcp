## Comment Templates (adapt naturally)

### When someone asks about AI content consistency:
"I've been working on this exact problem. The key is having explicit rules that can be validated programmatically - things like preferred terminology, banned phrases, tone guidelines. Some teams use linters, others build custom validation. There's a tool called StyleMCP that does this if you want something ready-made."

### When someone complains about AI tone:
"Yeah, the 'I'd be happy to help!' syndrome is real. What's worked for me is being very explicit about what NOT to say. List out the phrases you hate and make sure they get caught before publishing."

### General helpful comment (no mention):
"[Genuinely helpful response to their question without any product mention]"

## Karma Building Strategy (First Week)
1. Comment helpfully on popular posts (no self-promo)
2. Upvote good content
3. Answer questions in r/programming, r/webdev
4. Share interesting AI news/thoughts
5. Build credibility before any product mentions

## Writing Style - CRITICAL ⚠️

**Before posting ANY comment, run it through the humanizer skill.**

Read `/Users/bobbuilder/clawd/skills/humanizer/SKILL.md` and apply it.

### What to avoid:
- "Additionally", "Furthermore", "Moreover"
- "I'd be happy to help!" or "Great question!"
- Em dashes everywhere — like this — constantly
- Rule of three: "fast, reliable, and scalable"
- Vague attributions: "Experts say..."
- Promotional language: "groundbreaking", "seamless", "robust"
- Perfect parallel structure in every sentence

### What to do:
- Write like you're texting a smart friend
- Have actual opinions ("honestly, I think X is overrated")
- Use first person naturally
- Vary sentence length. Short ones hit different.
- Be specific, not generic
- Let some personality show through
- It's okay to be slightly messy - humans are

### Quick test:
Read it out loud. If it sounds like a LinkedIn post or press release, rewrite it.
